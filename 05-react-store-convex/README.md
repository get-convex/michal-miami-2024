Quick sample app to demonstrate distributed state mananagement in Convex. This
app isn't actually intended for use, it's just a strawman example for how state
changes dynamically propagate to multiple related components acrosss
multiple sessions and multiple users.

This demo is used for a two-minute clip shown during Jamstack 2022 and is
currently hosted at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdrO6IvHjRQ.

This is a Convex app, check out convex.dev and run through the onboarding
tutorial to get started.
